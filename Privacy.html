        PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND 
CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR 
UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. 
JavaBurn  DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN 
BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH
 THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION 
TO JavaBurn  OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED 
ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. The 
information collection, use, and dissemination practices of JavaBurn
        This policy applies to JavaBurn 's collection, use, storage and 
disclosure of information by JavaBurn  on its (a) websites, including 
all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the
 "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to JavaBurn 
's other information collection, including the purchase of customer 
lists from third parties. JavaBurn  is not responsible for the 
information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or 
applications. 1. Collection of Information. 1.1 Survey Information. JavaBurn
  collects information from individuals by various methods, including, 
but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a JavaBurn 
 survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, 
or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration 
pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used 
herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and 
related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, 
including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell 
phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, JavaBurn  or a third 
party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various 
information to JavaBurn  , which may include his or her name, email 
address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell 
phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education
 and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment 
information, personal and online interests, and such other information 
as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). 
JavaBurn  may also collect information concerning an individual from 
another source and uses that information in combination with information
 provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely 
voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey 
Information to JavaBurn  or Third Party, but an individual may receive 
incentives from JavaBurn  or a Third Party in exchange for providing 
Survey Information to JavaBurn . 1.2 Other Information. Other
 occasions when JavaBurn  obtains information from individuals include 
(1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to 
redeem an incentive offered by JavaBurn  or by a third party, (2) when 
an individual requests assistance through JavaBurn 's customer service 
department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a 
JavaBurn  service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. JavaBurn
  currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain 
Internet-related information about an individual with information about 
the individual in our database. Additionally, JavaBurn  may use other 
new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, 
"Technology Information"). (a) Cookies. A cookie is a 
small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's 
computer that allows JavaBurn  to identify the individual with his or 
her corresponding data that resides in JavaBurn 's database. You may 
read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use
 the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features
 and functionality of the Websites. (b) Web Beacons. A 
web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a
 web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for
 more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's 
unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database
 and associate the individual with previously acquired information about
 an individual in a database. This allows JavaBurn  to track certain web
 sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine 
products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track 
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, JavaBurn  
might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on 
the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an
 individual listed in JavaBurn 's database, visits the fishing website, 
JavaBurn  receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited 
the fishing site, and JavaBurn  would then update Bill's profile with 
the information that Bill is interested in fishing. JavaBurn  may 
thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to 
Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, JavaBurn  also uses
 web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in JavaBurn 's
 database. (c) New Technology. The use of technology on 
the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as
 is JavaBurn 's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, 
JavaBurn  strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any
 updates regarding its use of technology. 1.4 Outside Information. JavaBurn
  may receive information about individuals from third parties or from 
other sources of information outside of JavaBurn  including information 
located in public databases ("Outside Information"). 1.5 Individual Information. As
 used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third 
Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and 
Outside Information, and any other information JavaBurn  gathers or 
receives about individuals. 1.6 No Information Collected from Children. JavaBurn
  will never knowingly collect any personal information about children 
under the age of 13. If JavaBurn  obtains actual knowledge that it has 
collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that 
information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it 
does not collect such information, JavaBurn  has no such information to 
use or to disclose to third parties. JavaBurn  has designed this policy 
in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
("COPPA"). 1.7 Credit Card Information. JavaBurn  may in
 certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such
 as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an 
individual places an order from JavaBurn . When the Credit Card 
Information is submitted to JavaBurn , such information is encrypted and
 is protected with SSL encryption software. JavaBurn  will use the 
Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the 
purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed 
to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction. 2. Use of Individual Information. 2.1 Discretion to Use Information. THE
 COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE 
PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.
        The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how JavaBurn  
currently uses Individual Information, but JavaBurn  may change or 
broaden its use at any time. As noted below, JavaBurn  may update this 
policy from time to time. JavaBurn  may use Individual Information to 
provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising,
 telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, 
and package stuffers, among other possible uses. 2.2 Email. JavaBurn
  uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to 
individuals. JavaBurn  may maintain separate email lists for different 
purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a
 particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of 
each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. 2.2(a) Content of Email Messages. In
 certain commercial email messages sent by JavaBurn , an advertiser's 
name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will
 cause a reply email to be sent to JavaBurn . The "Subject:" line of 
JavaBurn  email messages will usually contain a line provided from the 
advertiser to JavaBurn . 2.2(b) Solicited Email. JavaBurn
  only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to 
receive email from JavaBurn  or to individuals who have agreed on third 
party websites to receive email from third parties such as JavaBurn . 
JavaBurn  does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, 
statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not 
applicable to JavaBurn 's email messages. 2.3 Targeted Advertising. JavaBurn
  uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. 
When an individual is using the Internet, JavaBurn  uses Technology 
Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with
 that person's Individual Information, and JavaBurn  attempts to show 
advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed 
an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
 Information, and otherwise. JavaBurn  may, at its discretion, target 
advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and 
other means of communication to provide promotional offers. 2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing. JavaBurn
  uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to 
individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using 
telephones and cell phones. 2.5 Use of Technology Information. JavaBurn
  uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information
 and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual 
Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a 
person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which 
areas of JavaBurn 's web sites are most frequently visited. This 
information helps JavaBurn  to better understand the online habits of 
individuals so that JavaBurn  can target advertising and promotions to 
them. 2.6 Profiles of Individuals. JavaBurn  uses 
Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can
 be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List 
Information with other sources of Individual Information such as 
information obtained from public databases. 2.7 Storage of Individual Information. JavaBurn
  stores the Individual Information in a database on JavaBurn  
computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in 
place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the 
information under JavaBurn 's control. Not withstanding such measures, 
JavaBurn  cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent 
JavaBurn  computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual 
Information on them stolen or altered. 3. Dissemination of Individual Information. 3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties. JavaBurn
  MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY 
PURPOSE IN JavaBurn 'S SOLE DISCRETION.
        If you do not wish us to use personal information about you to 
promote or sell our products and services or to sell, transfer or 
otherwise provide personal information about you to third parties, 
please inform us by sending us an email and we will certainly honor your
 request. 3.2 Order Fulfillment. JavaBurn  will transfer
 Individual Information to third parties when necessary to provide a 
product or service that a person orders from such third party while 
using JavaBurn  web sites or when responding to offers provided by 
JavaBurn . 3.3 Legal Process. JavaBurn  may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes. 3.4 Summary Data. JavaBurn
  may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such as summary 
or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of 
persons. 3.5 Access. Individuals have access to their 
Individual Information collected to provide an opportunity for an 
individual to correct, amend, or delete such information. Access can be 
obtained by contacting customer service at the number on the order page.
 JavaBurn  may also grant advertising clients and email services 
providers access to an individual's email address to verify the origin 
of the Individual Information collected. 4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties. 4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons. Advertising
 agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, 
"Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the 
Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other 
technology to collect information about individuals. JavaBurn  does not 
control Advertisers' use of such technology and JavaBurn  has no 
responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information 
about individuals. 4.2 Links. The Websites and email 
messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the web sites of third 
parties. JavaBurn  is not responsible for the privacy practices or the 
content of such other web sites. Linked web sites may contain links to 
web sites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your 
convenience and reference only. JavaBurn  does not operate or control in
 any respect any information, software, products or services available 
on such third party web sites. The inclusion of a link to a web site 
does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its 
contents, or its sponsoring organization. 4.3 Affiliated Companies. JavaBurn
  may disclose, transfer, and sell Individual Information to entities 
affiliated with JavaBurn  in JavaBurn 's discretion. 5. Unsubscribe Procedures. If
 you wish to discontinue receiving email messages from JavaBurn  please 
just click on the unsubscribe link on the bottom of the email message. We reserve the right to add Individual Information to multiple lists maintained by JavaBurn  For more information about protecting your privacy, you may wish to visit: www.ftc.gov
